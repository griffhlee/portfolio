            <h1>Media Year In Review - 2025</h1>
          <h4>Journal Entry - 12.31.2025</h4>
  
          <p>A mix of everything I listened to, watched, read, and viewed this year giving some accolades and shoutouts. Congrats to all participatants this year. 2025 was a fun one, and here is its time capsule.</p>
          <div class="entry-separator"></div>

        <section class="journal-entry">
            <h2>Film</h2>
            <h3>Favorite - One Battle After Another</h3>
            <img src="journal/in review/onebattle.jpg" alt="logo" class="logo">
            <p>I think PTA defines my 2025 as the director I watched the most of and learned the most about. In preparation for One Battle After Another, I watched Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both of which were excellent. This film was a massive effort, with great performances across the board. Shoutout to Chase Infiniti being from Indy and for the shift she put in.</p>
            <p>PTA is no stranger to a great soundtrack, and this one was graced by Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead, Steely Dan, and Tom Petty. A must see in theaters and a frontrunner for Best Picture.</p>
            <h3>Star Wars Binge</h3>
            <p>My summer was characterized by rewatching the Star Wars prequels and the original trilogy. I grew up on the prequels, playing with plastic lightsabers and LEGO Star Wars on the GameCube. I also went as Anakin for Halloween one year when I was maybe five. It was a great nostalgia trip and a reminder of just how good these movies are, including the prequels.</p>
            <h3>Needledrop Movies</h3>

                </iframe>
            </div>  
            <p>Some new movies I watched this year had soundtracks I kept on repeat. Adventureland carries a rock-laden soundtrack featuring The Replacements, Lou Reed, Yo La Tengo, and David Bowie. Garden State comes through with folk and indie staples from The Shins (above), Iron & Wine, and Simon & Garfunkel. Into The Wild rounds things out with original music from Eddie Vedder that puts you right in Alaska, alongside Supertramp.</p>
            <h3>In Theater</h3>
            <p>The Brutalist, Mickey 17, A Minecraft Movie, Sinners, The Phoenician Scheme, Superman, Weapons, One Battle After Another, Bugonia, Marty Supreme</p>
            <p>I think my favorite viewing experience was The Brutalist, though released in 2024. The big brass soundtrack is monumental to hear in a theater. Marty Supreme was a nice touch at the end of the year.</p>
            <h3>New Watches</h3>
            <p>First time watches this year that I enjoyed (Not released in '25):</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <h3>Top Artist: Wilco</h3>
            <img src="journal/in review/wilco.jpg" alt="logo" class="logo">
            <p>Living in Connecticut for just shy of nine months and commuting into NYC, I found myself pulled between two lifestyles that demanded different music. Connecticut leaned folk-induced, with the likes of Jim Croce, Glen Campbell, and Simon & Garfunkel; whereas NYC was rock-heavy with The Cure, Cocteau Twins, and The Velvet Underground. Wilco found itself nestled between the two, carrying both folk and rock elements.</p>
            <p>Because of that, it’s no surprise they claimed the top artist spot for the year. The funny thing with music that I always think about is that you can listen to a song/artist for years and think not much more about it rather than a playlist rotational piece, and then all of a sudden one day it sounds a little different. I think music has a way of finding us when we are ready to hear it, and Wilco was that for me in 2025.</p>
            <p>Favorite songs: California Stars, Forget the Flowers, Passenger Side, Summer Teeth, When You Wake up Feeling Old, Hate It Here</p>
            <h3>Best New Artist: Cameron Winter & Geese</h3>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGE-JRsJ2uo" 
                        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" 
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
                        allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
            </div>  
            <p>Not much else to say about them that hasn’t already been said. I first heard “Love Takes Miles” on my walk home from work in May and thought it was an odd yet addictive track. I decided to listen to Winter’s album, Heavy Metal, all the way through the following day and was affirmed in my intrigue during the “God is real” bit at the end of “$0.”</p>
            <p>I hadn’t heard of Geese yet until I stumbled upon their cover of “Baby” by Justin Bieber online and thought it sounded like Cameron’s unique vocals, which is when I put two and two together. From there, I went down the rabbit hole, as many have, of the Geese discography. Serendipitously, it aligned perfectly with the Geese takeover. They released “Taxes” a couple of weeks later and then the full album, Getting Killed, which became my top album of 2025.</p>
            <p>The album was released one day before I moved to New York, so it will always be ingrained in my first months here.</p>
            <p>I think the best way to explain the rise of Cameron Winter and Geese is the desire for young people to have a rock band to cling to. We were too young to see the early days and rise of The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, and the indie rock scene of the 2000s. Geese feel like a breath of fresh air in the scene and haven’t left people’s mouths since. It’s special to be here in New York at the time of their jump.</p>
            <h3>Oasis are Back!!!</h3>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315"

            </div>  
            <p>In anticipation of the Oasis reunion and with tickets in hand to see them at MetLife in September, I was fully engulfed in them this year. I’ve been a fan for some time, but this year felt different. I dug into B-sides and demos to prepare. Due to unfortunate timing with my Scotland trip, I was unable to go (sorry Sebastian).</p>
            <p>Still, I kept listening, and they reached their peak for me while I was over in the UK. Pints of Guinness and Oasis made for quite the pairing. Lately, I’ve had their live album at Knebworth on repeat as my going out tune.</p>
            <h3>YouTube Tracks</h3>
            <p>I listen to a lot of music on YouTube while I work, mainly live performances, Tiny Desk concerts, covers, and whatever else. Below is one of my favorites from the year by my friend, Alex Turner. A great folk, stripped-back tune. Check out this song, along with his other originals and covers, on his channel.</p>

            <h3>Travels With Charley - John Steinbeck</h3>
            <img src="journal/in review/charley.jpg" alt="logo" class="logo">
            <p>I didn’t read a whole lot this year. I did, however, finish a book I had been holding onto for years, picking it up and putting it down. After a while of my friends digging on me for always carrying it around and rereading page ten, I finally finished Travels with Charley. It’s a story from Steinbeck, who in his later years converted a truck and explored the US in search of truth with his trusty companion, Charley. It’s a trip I hope to take one day, inspired by Steinbeck.</p>

            <p>Went to the Whitney in NYC and saw a good amount of Edward Hopper, one of my favorites. This one titled Seven A.M was a standout for me.</p>

            <p>2025 was a sneaky one for media. It would be hard to top ’23 and ’24, which were two years full of discovery and revolution for me, but as shown above, there are still many takeaways. As long as you keep consuming new work and opening your mind to different styles, you'll be alright.</p>
