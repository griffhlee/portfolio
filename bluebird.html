                    <h3>There's a bluebird that wants to get out.</h3>
                    <p>A recent college graduate, lost and uncertain about his future, embarks on a cross-country journey to escape his past. Surrounded by old memories and facing an unclear path ahead, he searches for meaning and direction. The film delves into themes of self-discovery, nostalgia, and the struggle to confront unresolved emotions.</p>
                    <h3>Author's note</h3>
                    <p>I started filming and documenting my life back in May, not knowing exactly where it would take me. What came of it was a story both true and honest—capturing moments of uncertainty, reflection, and the search for meaning. This film is a window into the raw, unfiltered journey of trying to figure out what comes next when the future feels unclear. It’s personal, but in many ways, it’s a story we all know—an exploration of leaving behind the familiar and confronting the unknown.</p>

                <h2>Bluebird by Charles Bukowski</h2>
                
                <p>there's a bluebird in my heart that
                    wants to get out
                    but I'm too tough for him,
                    I say, stay in there, I'm not going
                    to let anybody see
                    you.
                    there's a bluebird in my heart that
                    wants to get out
                    but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
                    cigarette smoke
                    and the whores and the bartenders
                    and the grocery clerks
                    never know that
                    he's
                    in there.
                    
                    there's a bluebird in my heart that
                    wants to get out
                    but I'm too tough for him,
                    I say,
                    stay down, do you want to mess
                    me up?
                    you want to screw up the
                    works?
                    you want to blow my book sales in
                    Europe?
                    there's a bluebird in my heart that
                    wants to get out
                    but I'm too clever, I only let him out
                    at night sometimes
                    when everybody's asleep.
                    I say, I know that you're there,
                    so don't be
                    sad.
                    then I put him back,
                    but he's singing a little
                    in there, I haven't quite let him
                    die
                    and we sleep together like
                    that
                    with our
                    secret pact
                    and it's nice enough to
                    make a man
                    weep, but I don't
                    weep, do
                    you?</p>
