        <p>Here are some of my favorite movie soundtracks. No particular order, just great movies and songs.</p>

            <h2>Elf (2003)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Jon Favreau</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Main Title, Pennies From Heaven, You Make Me Feel So Young, Sleigh Ride, What Christmas Means to Me</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315"

            </div>
            <p>Arguably my favorite movie of all time. The amount of nostalgia that this opening scene pumps through my veins is unreal. I watch this once a year on Christmas Eve every year, and it is just a perfect movie in all respects. I can watch this clip and be completely rushed with all the feel-goodness of it, and that's what a movie should do. </p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>

            <h2>The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Wes Anderson</h4>
            <h4>Songs: These Days, Lullabye, Stephanie Says, Wigwam, Fly, Everyone </h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5SRdYsscLc"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Start to end a perfect soundtrack. Off the rip with Hey Jude, then going into the Velvet Underground, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, The Clash, and more. These songs hit all their marks and Wes went full music bro with this one. Some movies would be lucky to have one of these songs, but this one is stacked with 'em.</p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>Submarine (2010)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Richard Ayoade</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Piledriver Waltz, Stuck on the Puzzle, Glass in the park, Hiding Tonight</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dU1088OxwxY"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Per my Spotify 2024 top songs, Stuck on the puzzle and Piledriver waltz were my number 1 and 2 most listened to songs. I think I listen to this soundtrack the most on a daily basis. These songs are just brilliant by Alex Turner, and it makes this movie especially unique because of it.</p>


            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>Lost in Translation (2003)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Sofia Coppola</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Girls, Too Young, sometimes, Brass in Pocket</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSsNbFwePAE"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Maybe it's cause I listened to this soundtrack the whole time I was in Japan, but I've got a special place for this one too. The scene above of Bill Murray's character first looking at those lights with the song is how I felt. Again, maybe cause I was trying to recreate this scene. Anyways, Coppola and Anderson have similar styles when it comes to music choices.</p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>The Graduate (1967)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Mike Nichols</h4>
            <h4>Songs: The Sound of Silence, Mrs. Robinson, April Come She Will, Scarborough Fair</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLQphyy4YNw"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Who doesn't want to listen to Simon & Garfunkel for 2 hours? I mean maybe some people, but I'm not one. Especially since I finally connected who Mrs. Robinson was after watching this. It's a great movie about figuring out your shit after college and the music matches it perfectly.</p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>About Time (2013)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Richard Curtis</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Mid Air, Friday I'm In Love, How Long Will I Love You, Gold in Them Hills, The Luckiest</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNzgjFDt14w"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>This soundtrack is the perfect mix of fun and absoultey heartbreaking. Going from Friday I'm in Love to the Luckiest? Cmon now, chill out. The first time I watched this and Mid Air played, something great was happening. Now it's one of my favorite movies of all time.</p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>

            <h2>Blue Velvet (1986)</h2>
            <h4>Director: David Lynch</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Blue Velvet, In Dreams, Love Letters</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Rest in peace David Lynch. The scene above with In Dreams by Roy Orbison is just so wacky I love it. The opening with the title song Blue Velvet playing is amazing and made me realize I was gonna love this movie.</p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>Good Will Hunting (1997)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Gus Van Sant</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Say Yes, No Name #3, Between the Bars, Angeles, Miss Misery</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>I mean a movie stacked with songs from Either/Or and what brought us Miss Misery has to be included here. Thank you Elliott Smith and thank you Matt and Ben.</p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>500 Days of Summer (2009)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Marc Webb</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Sweet Disposition, Us, Hero, Bookends, She's Got You High </h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PfpYsVVUPJ0" 
                        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>"I love the Smiths." Okay yeah that's pretty great Summer, but we've also got Regina Spektor throughout this thing with some Temper Trap and Mumm-Ra. Here's another example of a really unique soundtrack that hits all the right marks and one you can listen to on its own outside of the movie. </p>

            <div class="entry-separator"></div>
            <h2>Midnight In Paris (2011)</h2>
            <h4>Director: Woody Allen</h4>
            <h4>Songs: Si tu vois me mere, Recado, Let's Do It Let's Fall In Love</h4>
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" 
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAw7kaJWsR0" 
                        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" 
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
                        allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>This is up there for my favorite intro to a movie ever. The rest of the soundtrack is total fun. Similar to Lost in Translation, I listened to this on repeat when I was in Paris for the first time in 2023, so it is ingrained in my head. Did you know Sidney Bechet shot someone because they said he played the wrong note?</p>
